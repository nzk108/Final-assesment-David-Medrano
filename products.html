            <p class="con">Sport at Rosmini College is an integral element of holistic education and helps promote a healthy and active lifestyle. We have a strong sporting culture and value performance at both the elite and participation levels, offering competitive opportunities in various codes. It is important for young men to involve themselves with physical endeavours throughout their time at school and sport offers a platform for this.

            <h3  class="con1">Director of Sport
            Rhys Edwards is our Director of Sport at Rosmini College, overseeing the Sports programme across the whole college, and working to grow and foster a lifelong interest in sports participation in all students. “I aim to develop a sports programme where all boys regardless of their ability have the opportunity to excel in their own way".
            
            As an Old Boy, Rhys is determined to maintain the important sporting traditions at the College. “Rosmini’s sporting successes have always been underpinned by its strong values. Our boys understand that taking part in sport is a privilege and not a right. It’s important to keep our expectations high of the boys when they represent the College, so that they conduct themselves in the best way possible, both on and off the field.”
