                  Rosmini College is a Catholic Boys’ School founded by the Rosminian order to provide a Catholic education to young men on Auckland’s North Shore. We aim to shape them into well-rounded young men ready to leave school who are able to make a positive contribution to society and are empowered to serve others by living out the founder’s maxims.
